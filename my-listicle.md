# List of SCP Objects
### Ones I think would be neat to see in either *SCP - Containment Breach* or *SCP: Secret Laboratory*.

- [SCP-527 - "The Burning Man"][1]
    > **SCP - Containment Breach**:
    > It could replace the guaranteed SCP-106 spawn and the SCP-966 instances in the maintenance tunnels, making the area much more memorable; although it might feel a bit similar to SCP-939's area.
    > 
    > **SCP Secret Laboratory**:
    > I could see an SCP that consumes items (barring important ones; the ones SCP-3114 cannot pick up) and corpses in order to grow stronger. It could have a fuel gauge instead of a health bar, and it gains abilities the more fuel it has. Taking damage will lower fuel, and using abilities would cost fuel; fuel degrading over time could also work, although might be too annoying/punishing. At a really high fuel count, it could even split off into a second, weaker instance, at the cost of reducing its own fuel cap; the second instance would pull from a random spectator.
- [SCP-035 - "Possessive Mask"][2]
    > **SCP: Secret Laboratory**:
    > SCP-035 would work similarly to a human, albeit with more health and a few extra abilities. After some time, however, it will begin to degrade, losing maximum health; it will need to find a new host to prevent this. It can be done on corpses (the age of which will affect the starting degredation), or living humans in a similar way to SCP-3114's strangulation. As with SCP-3114, it wouldn't be able to pick up certain items.
- [SCP-248 - "110%"][3]
    > **SCP - Containment Breach**:
    > A simple item that can be combined with others to slightly increase their capabilities. The S-Nav's screen would be slightly zoomed out, allowing improved visibility, items like the wallet and clipboard would be able to hold more items, items that require batteris would last longer, etc.. It would not work on keycards.
    >
    > **SCP: Secret Laboratory**:
    > Similar to how it could work in SCP - Containment Breach, it will improve item stats by up to 10% multiplicatively. Multiple can be placed onto one item (up to 2), further increasing its capabilities but causing the item to be on a timer; once the timer runs out, the item loses the boons provided and recieves a permanent penalty to its stats. It would not be able to be placed on SCP items. Radios would have increased range and battery life, weapons would have a 10% improvement to all stats (including ammo capacity), body armor will be able to carry more reserve ammo and resist a bit more damage,  grenades would have a 10% larger explosion radius and 10% less damage falloff, the special weapons like the Jailbird would gain an extra charge, the Micro H.I.D.'s energy capacity would increase by 10% and its energy consumption would decrease by 10% (also means that one can charge the weapon for a longer period of time without it overcharging), healing items heal/last 10% longer, and candy bags can hold an additional candy. (And maybe flashlights could be 10% brighter for the fun of it.) As with SCP - Containment Breach, it would not work on keycards.
- [SCP-668 - "13'' Chef's Knife"][4]
    > **SCP: Secret Laboratory**:
    > A melee weapon that, when used on a human, grants the user high damage resistance from their target, as well as weaker damage resistance from all bystanders; this effect can only be applied to one target at a time. If this effect is not in place, the user will instead get a minor damage resistance when looking at a human, along with an increase to walking speed (not running speed) and stamina duration, being applied in the same manner as SCP-049-2's speed boost; again the resistance only works on humans. Its damage would be much lower than other melee weapons, at around 25, although would also have a damage bonus vs. SCP-049-2 instances. Getting kills applies a permanent "bloodlust" effect, which stacks wiht each kill up to a maximum of 5. "Bloodlust" would increase the damage of SCP-668 by 5 each tier, the damage resistance provided by it, walking speed, as well as allowing them to generate hume shield when holding SCP-668 (5 per tier); however, "bloodlust" also reduces the user's profficency with other weapons, reducing accuracy, reload speed, equip speed, etc.. Another possibility is that, once the user gets enough kills with SCP-668, they become _solely_ reliant on it, not being able to carry any other weapons at all; they could potentially also no longer be connected to a team, à la evil candy/SCP-021-J, but that's even more outlandish.
    > One other note is that most of this concept is based on a _misconception_ I had many years back regarding SCP-668, but with SCP: Secret Laboratory's lore of the SCPs mutating, it could actually fit in quite well.
- [SCP-2398 - "Home Run Bat"][5]
    > **SCP: Secret Laboratory**:
    > A simple, more humorous idea. It's a melee weapon that deals around 35 damage. On kill, it creates a decently-sized explosion, although probably not as damaging as a grenade. The explosion also deals around 50 self-damage, so be careful. This does have overlap with the Jailbird, although is weaker and does not break.
    > (Did this one so I had 5 items in this list, sorry.)

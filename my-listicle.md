# List of SCP Objects
### Ones I think would be neat to see in either *SCP - Containment Breach* or *SCP: Secret Laboratory*.

- [SCP-527 - "The Burning Man"][1]
    > **SCP - Containment Breach**:
    > It could replace the guaranteed SCP-106 spawn and the SCP-966 instances in the maintenance tunnels, making the area much more memorable; although it might feel a bit similar to SCP-939's area.
    > 
    > **SCP Secret Laboratory**:
    > I could see an SCP that consumes items (barring important ones; the ones SCP-3114 cannot pick up) and corpses in order to grow stronger. It could have a fuel gauge instead of a health bar, and it gains abilities the more fuel it has. Taking damage will lower fuel, and using abilities would cost fuel; fuel degrading over time could also work, although might be too annoying/punishing. At a really high fuel count, it could even split off into a second, weaker instance, at the cost of reducing its own fuel cap; the second instance would pull from a random spectator.
- [SCP-035 - "Possessive Mask"][2]
    > **SCP: Secret Laboratory**:
    > SCP-035 would work similarly to a human, albeit with more health and a few extra abilities. After some time, however, it will begin to degrade, losing maximum health; it will need to find a new host to prevent this. It can be done on corpses (the age of which will affect the starting degredation), or living humans in a similar way to SCP-3114's strangulation.
